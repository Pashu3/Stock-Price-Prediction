**Stock Price Prediction Project**

This repository contains the code and datasets for stock price prediction of two different companies, namely Amazon and Tesla. The prediction models are implemented using three different algorithms: Linear Regression, XGBoost, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The project structure includes two folders and two files.

**Project Structure**

[Amazon_Datasets](/Amazon_Datasets/AMZN.csv) - This folder contains the dataset file for Amazon stock price prediction.

[Tesla_Datasets](/Tesla%20Datasets/TSLA.csv) - This folder contains the dataset file for Tesla stock price prediction.

[Amazon_stock_Price_Predction](/Stock_Price_prediction_using_LR_and_XGB_1.ipynb) - This Jupyter Notebook file implements Amazon stock price prediction using Linear Regression (LR) and XGBoost algorithms.

[Tesla_stock_prediction](/Tesla_Stock_Price_Prediction.ipynb) - This Jupyter Notebook file implements Tesla stock price prediction using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm.

**Instructions:**

To run the stock price prediction models, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   git clone <https://github.com/Pashu3/Stock-Price-Prediction.git>

2. Navigate to the [Amazon_Datasets](/Amazon_Datasets/AMZN.csv) folder and download the dataset file for Amazon stock price prediction. Make sure the dataset file is named appropriately.

3. Open the [Amazon_stock_Price_Predction](/Stock_Price_prediction_using_LR_and_XGB_1.ipynb) .pynb file in Jupyter Notebook file using Jupyter or any compatible environment.

4. Follow the instructions provided within the Jupyter Notebook to execute the code and observe the results for Amazon stock price prediction using Linear Regression and XGBoost algorithms.

5. Repeat steps 2-4 for Tesla stock price prediction:

     * Navigate to the [Tesla_datasets](/Tesla%20Datasets/TSLA.csv) folder and download the dataset file for Tesla stock price prediction.Ensure the dataset file is named correctly.
     * Open the [Tesla_stock_prediction](/Tesla_Stock_Price_Prediction.ipynb) .pynb file in Jupyter Notebook file in your preferred environment.
     * Execute the code as per the instructions within the Jupyter Notebook to perform Tesla stock price prediction using the LSTM algorithm.

Feel free to explore the code, modify it, and experiment with different algorithms to improve the stock price prediction accuracy.

**Note:** Please ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed before running the code. Refer to the code files for the required libraries and their versions.
